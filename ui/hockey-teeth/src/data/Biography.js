  "HOCKEY TEETH is like every band you've ever heard before, just better and with catchier songs. HOCKEY TEETH has been compared to Hippo Campus, Phoenix, and even Sugar Ray. But HOCKEY TEETH does not know any of these posers.",
  "Combining the high energy of modern rock live performance with the catchy melodies of power pop, Hockey Teeth aims to redefine indie music in the Pacific Northwest.",
  "Formed in 2019 while cleaning dishes at the Ridgeway commons, Hockey Teeth has always felt like a lucky, chance meeting between founding members Riley Adair, Joey Boone, and Owen Rollison. Having strong support from the local music scene in Bellingham, WA from the beginning, Hockey Teeth won Western Washington University's 2020 Sounds of the Underground battle of the bands as only their third show.",
  "After being shut down like the rest of the world for the better part of a year and a half, Hockey Teeth stayed busy working in the studio self-recording, mixing, and producing their debut EP \"Go There\". They welcomed back live performances in summer 2021 with the addition of Zach Grande finally bringing Go There to life. Following their return, they played long anticipated shows at WWU's Lawnstock festival, BAMF!, and opened for established acts such as Argonaut & Wasp, Water From Your Eyes, Naked Giants, and Acid Tongue among others.",
  "Blending inspiration from mid-2000s, raw, indie sound and jazzy, active, melodic bass playing, Hockey Teethâ€™s newest single \"Dialtone\" puts you in 1990s Tokyo with its chimey guitars, jazzy chords, angular melodies, and fast but comforting pace.",
  "HOCKEY TEETH is cool, DIALTONE is cool, are YOU cool?"
