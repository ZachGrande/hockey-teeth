  'Hockey Teeth is like every band you\'ve ever heard before, just better and with catchier songs. Hockey Teeth has been compared to Hippo Campus, Phoenix, Elvis Costello, and even Sugar Ray.',
  'Combining the high energy of modern rock live performance with the catchy melodies of traditional mid 60s pop, Hockey Teeth brings a fresh take at the classic power pop genre.',
  'Formed in 2019 while cleaning dishes at the Ridgeway commons, Hockey Teeth has always felt like a lucky, chance meeting between members Riley Adair, Joey Boone, Owen Rollison, and Zach Grande.

They have had the pleasure of sharing the stage with established acts such as Mr Twin Sister, Water From Your Eyes, Naked Giants, Argonaut & Wasp, and Acid Tongue.',
