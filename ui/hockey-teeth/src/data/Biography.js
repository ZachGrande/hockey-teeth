  'Hockey Teeth is a Seattle-based power pop band blending the high energy of modern rock with the catchy melodies of mid-60s pop. Their music offers a fresh and infectious take on the classic power pop sound, drawing comparisons to Phoenix, Elvis Costello, Hippo Campus, and Wilco.',
  'Formed in 2019 in the dish room at Western Washington University\'s Ridgeway Commons, the band began when Riley Adair and Joey Boone bonded over their love of music. Riley brought in classmate Owen Rollison, and the three immediately started writing songs together. Joey later welcomed childhood best friend Zach Grande into the band in 2021 to complete the lineup.',
  'Hockey Teeth quickly gained traction in the Bellingham, WA music scene, winning Western Washington University’s Battle of the Bands in only their third show. Since then, they’ve played numerous festivals including Capitol Hill Block Party and Bellingham Arts and Music Festival, and have opened for acts like Mr Twin Sister, Naked Giants, Water From Your Eyes, Argonaut & Wasp, and Acid Tongue.',
  'Now based in Seattle, the band continues to build momentum with their debut full-length album, \'Cut Your Teeth\' (2025).',
